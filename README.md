# Sign-Language-Detection
•Developed working model using LSTM layers and Mediapipe holistic for ’Sign Language Detection’.
•Implemented Opencv to get real time user actions to recognize their actions for sign language detection.
•Used Mediapipe Holistic for collecting keypoints of users hands,Body and face.
•Used LSTM layer to train neural network for predicting actions form number of frame
